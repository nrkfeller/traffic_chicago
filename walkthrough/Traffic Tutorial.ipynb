    "Datalow is a distributed processing backend. Beam is usedas a programming model to define and execute data pipelines. Beam pipelines can run on Apex, Fink, Spark or Dataflow. Data can either be streamed of batch (bulk DB migration process) processed. Java and Python. Workers on dataflow are rebalanced to pretty much all finish at the same time! Best thing to produce aggregations.\n",
